# GeneticAlgorithm

GeneticAlgorithm for testing paralazing.

## Getting Started

This project concentrates for creating genetic algorithm writen in programming language D. This library will be paralized for better perfomance and better output. This project is school work for testing paralazing techniques.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
install dub, dmd
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you have to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
dub run
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

## Deployment

Add additional notes about how to deploy this on a live system
